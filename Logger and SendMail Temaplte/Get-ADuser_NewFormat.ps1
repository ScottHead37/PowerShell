        .SYNOPSIS
        Features the SendMail Module and Logger Module from my GitHub Site

        .DESCRIPTION
        Whenever possible dynamic data that may need to change will be imported from Mail.csv
        The reason for this is if the script is static, and we can sign the script, and it wonâ€™t change
